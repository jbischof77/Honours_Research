# Honours_Research
The code for my Honours research project.

This code consists of 3 python files; one for collecting data, one for performing EDA on the data, and one for training the machine learning models. The API key has been excluded for privacy reasons.

The timeline_by_match() method has very little documentation and so the data returned by the method is documented in the Riot_API_documentation.pdf.

The required packages are included in required_install.txt
